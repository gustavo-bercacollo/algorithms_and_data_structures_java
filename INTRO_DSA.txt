DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.
Using the right data structure and algorithm makes you program run faster, especially when working with lot of data.
