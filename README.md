# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java Study

This repository was created with the goal of studying and implementing the main data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language. The focus is to enhance understanding of these fundamental concepts for programming and solving problems efficiently.

## Data Structures

The repository contains implementations of various commonly used data structures in algorithms and software development, such as:

- **Lists**: ArrayList, LinkedList
- **Queues and Stacks**
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, AVL Trees
- **Graphs**: Implementations of directed and undirected graphs
- **Hash Tables**

## Algorithms

Here you will find implementations of classic algorithms, including:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search
- **Graph Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra
- **String Algorithms**: KMP, Substring Search
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn and apply data structures and algorithms in Java. It is organized in a way that allows easy addition of new examples and improvements to existing implementations.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to open a **pull request** with improvements, fixes, or new example implementations.
